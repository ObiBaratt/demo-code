# demo-code
Sanitized code from a current contract. The three files I uploaded include:
- Search component with useState and useEffect hooks, and functions to control the search result list modal.
- SearchList component with the other half of the modal behavior logic.
- The Full Text Search API with tablenames censored to that searches the apps Postgres database for data from two specific tables.
